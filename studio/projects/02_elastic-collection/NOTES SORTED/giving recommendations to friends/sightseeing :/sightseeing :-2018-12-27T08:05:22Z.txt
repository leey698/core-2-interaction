sightseeing :

bukchon hanok village (korean traditional house village where you walk around and take pics) -> then go samcheongdong or insadong for food or really nice cafes (they’re right next to the village)

namsan tower (highest point in seoul and you can see the whole city when you go to the top)

 gyeongbokgung palace / gwanghwamun

starfield coex mall (the one with really pretty library)

shopping:

myeongdong : it’s the most popular/biggest shopping district esp for foreigners and it’s nice to look around, but the markets mostly only target tourists and stuff is kinda overpriced there. so if you want to shop street clothes i wouldn’t recommend, but makeup and branded clothes the price is the same everywhere so it’s ok to shop there

hongdae : the street clothes are super cheap here and there are a lot of food/small shops you can go. but its really crowded so avoid weekends!! oh yeah there are also a lot of kpop buskings here too

gangnam : shopping district is super big, lots and lots of restaurants and it has all kinds of shops varying from street to designer brands! if you go gangnam i really recommend the underground (subway station) shopping district

garosugil : this place has heaps of aesthetic cafes, and also a lot of clothing shops. it’s just one really long street so you just walk along and shop, and the street is pretty aesthetic as well

** shops/ brands i really recommend : 
wonderplace : streetwear shop that sells like thrasher and korean street brands
A-land : similar to wonderplace, but it has heaps more aesthetic accessories, bags etc
Aroundthecorner : i really recommend this place, it sells champion, thrasher and heaps of korean brands that are really nice for cheap
SPAO : nice to look around if it’s on sale lol
