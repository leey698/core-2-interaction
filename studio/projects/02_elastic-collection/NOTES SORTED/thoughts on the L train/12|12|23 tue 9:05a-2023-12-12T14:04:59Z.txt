this is going to be my last train ride to this interaction class... thank fuck ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­

I've been so unbelievably unmotivated for this class. I've never felt this drained, frustrated, and avoidant with any other class. to think that this is my last train ride to this class, I do of course feel a sense of regretâ€”regretting that I was never on time, never gave it my 100 (not even 50 tbh), and didn't even really try to make things work. hopefully on the train ride back today, Iâ€™ll feel more relieved that it's done at least.
