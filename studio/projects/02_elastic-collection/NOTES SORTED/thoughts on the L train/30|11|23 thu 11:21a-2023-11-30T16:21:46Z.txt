on my way to yoga class, and I'm on one of the front carriages today since I'm getting off on 3rd ave. there's a very pretty man fitted up in grey/rusty washed jeans, some cool silver necklaces and rings, and a thin pair of silver framed glasses. looks like a comfy fit but looks fitted cos of the accessories and black leather shoes. there are quite a few fitted up people on this train today. a girl that looks identical to cardi b just embarked the train and sat right across me LOL
