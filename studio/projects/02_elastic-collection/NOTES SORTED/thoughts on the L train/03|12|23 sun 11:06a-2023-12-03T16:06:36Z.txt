I'm heading to Hudson Yards for a Korean skincare event today. The weather is ass and has been raining since the morning, which automatically put me in a bad mood, but we have places to be. Because of the humidity, the L train is musty and hard to breathe in. I also just think some stinky people are in this carriage rn.
