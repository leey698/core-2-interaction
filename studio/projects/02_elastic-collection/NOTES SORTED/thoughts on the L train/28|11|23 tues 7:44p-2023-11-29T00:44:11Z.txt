a bboy performed some impressive pole dance and got off at bedford ave. l trains are always full of funky people, good and bad way. whenever I encounter subway dancers, I thoroughly enjoy their performances. their hat tricks are honestly so impressive. 

right across me was a white man that looked very high and drowsy. he was trying to type something but his fingers were barely working, and he could barely even keep his eyes open. he kept leaning towards his right side as if he were falling asleep. he stood up and got off at lorimer, hope he got off at the right stop. I lowkey worry about these people sometimes, am I being too naive to be caring for random druggos on the train?
