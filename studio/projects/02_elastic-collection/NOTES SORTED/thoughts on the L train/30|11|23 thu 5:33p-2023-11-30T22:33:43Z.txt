not on my usual l train today, because I went to apple and uniqlo in soho. luckily I got on this M train before rush hour? so it's not jam packed body to body. or, maybe it's just that L train is always so fucking packed all the time so this train feels really empty. it's 5:35 pm and already pitch black outside. 

as I write these notes down I realised that I often like to observe other train commuters' facial expressions and outfits. it feels like everyone's facial expressions match their outfits. like if someone's super fitted up w maison margiela tabi boots and some sunglasses, I would never witness a smile on their face. always straight poker model face. oh nvm I just saw a girl wearing a leather jacket and tabi flats and she smiled... at her bf though. anyone can smile at the dumbest things when they're with someone they love are in love with!
