For some strange reason, the train didn't run as often as they normally do. The screen that tells the train times said: Manhattan 0 min (flashing), and then 7 min. 7??? wtf, it's rush hour, 7 mins is unacceptable. Morning is not going so well but it only got worse when this random girl in scrubs would make the tiniest little space for me to fit on the seats. What does she gain from that. Like move over just a tad bit more and everyone would be at peace. I still squeezed myself in the tiny space that was given to me and decided to write some shit down so I feel better. I was kind contemplating getting back up because I'm so squished rn, but lowkey glad I sat cos the train is so damn packed rn. It stopped at Lorimer St Station and some people seem to be just waiting for the next train since this one is too full. Everyone on the train is quite bundled up this morning, but not as much as the people on Montreal. There's a girl weaeing a khaki trench coat, light blue jeans, pointy boots (??) and a chunky white scarf, and I really like her style. I also should look into getting a scarf soon
