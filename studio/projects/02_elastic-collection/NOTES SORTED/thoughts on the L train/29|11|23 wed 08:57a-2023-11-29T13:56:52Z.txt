quite a full train today, but it was lovely. 2 buskers (could be a couple, not sure) sang a song accompanied by an acoustic guitar, and the girl's voice was so clear and nice to listen to. I found an empty seat right where they were performing, so I got to watch the performance like a VIP and remembered--I have a 1 dollar bill in my wallet! I don't think I've ever tipped a subway busker, or let alone any buskers in NY, but I felt like today was the day. I rushed to whip my $1 bill out of my wallet to put it in the female busker's money collecting tote bag, and got a very sincere 'thank you' in return. everyone else on the train is also not so crazy or disrespectful. maybe wednesday mornings make everyone behave a bit better lol!
