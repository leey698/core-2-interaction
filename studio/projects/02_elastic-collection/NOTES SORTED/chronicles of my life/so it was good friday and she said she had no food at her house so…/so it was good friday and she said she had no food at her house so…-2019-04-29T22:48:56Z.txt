so it was good friday and she said she had no food at her house so she came chats to buy grocery and get dinner with me
but then we realised everything was closed including woolies so we couldn’t get any grocery
but she KEPT telling me thaht she had no food at home
like none
so i was lke oh we probs like still need some
so i was trying to look thru my fridge to see if i can bring something
and then i found the tteokbokki package u just add water and boil
and i was like happy that we found food
so i was like oh should we brinig this??
and then she gives me this awks smile and go “i don’t really eat so you can eat it by yourself”
i was like i don’t really eat in hols
and EVEN if you ACTUALLY don’t eat at all when someone comes over its the courtesy to provide them food
