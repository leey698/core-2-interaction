Shower thoughts (샤워할때는 아인슈타인)
음식의 1인분은 누구한테 맞춰진 1인분인가
they say life is short, but it is the longest thing you’ll ever experience
why is 100% out of 100
the earth is constantly spinning but we only remember the map as one orientation
to kids who are born recently, the telephone sign 
what colours make white? 
when you watch vlogs, you are witnessing a person who doesn’t even know you exist
