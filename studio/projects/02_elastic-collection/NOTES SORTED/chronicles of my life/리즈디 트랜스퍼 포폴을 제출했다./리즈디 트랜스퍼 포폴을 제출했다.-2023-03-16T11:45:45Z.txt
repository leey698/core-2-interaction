리즈디 트랜스퍼 포폴을 제출했다.

마감 직전까지 원서를 고치고, 포폴 작업을 하다 드디어 냈다. 어제 밤새 잠을 못자서 너무 피곤하다.

If you're focused on something and grind for an extended period, I feel like your body adapts to it quite quickly and goes in full work mode. I feel this way whenever a deadline is close - I'm usually able to eventually get the design and idea I want in the matter of days or even hours. But when I'm done with something, I'm just so sick of  the idea of working and I feel like I literally shut myself down from any work. Rest is important and much needed of course, but I feel like I learned so much from being so focused on my work and my projects the past few weeks. It was probably my most transformative and fast growing time period in my design journey yet, so wouldn't it be a waste to just throw this all away?

let's keep working and learning, and keep improving. all i have right now is time, and with this much passion and knowledge i have in my design, i know i can keep creating so many more cool things.
