Non-union revision surgery on 17/7/23

17/7/2023

about yesterday
Checked in the hospital at around 3pm yesterday, and I signed a bunch of agreement papers as soon as I arrived. A female doctor came to explain the surgery procedure in detail, and I found out that I'm cutting my right pelvis for the bone graft. sad

they also checked my blood pressure, temperature, and allergy reaction to antibiotic shots. then, they inserted this super thick needle for the IV drip into the side of my wrist and man it was pretty painful..

after all that, it was dinner time at 6:00pm. dinner was 미역국, 마파두부 with some korean 반찬s. i tried to eat as much as possible because i knew i would be hungry after fasting. i was right, I'm writing this at 1:30pm the next day and I'm hungry as hell.
i felt a bit lonely eating alone so i called 서영 and she didnt pick up, so i called alicia. it was nice chatting w her

i fell asleep soon after we hung up, which was around 8pm. 

Today (surgery day)

2:31pm
