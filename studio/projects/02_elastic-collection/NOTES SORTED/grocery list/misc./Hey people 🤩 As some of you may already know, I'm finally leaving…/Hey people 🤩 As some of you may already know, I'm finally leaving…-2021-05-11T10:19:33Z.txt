Hey people ü§© As some of you may already know, I'm finally leaving to NYC this July and I wanted to have a small farewell party / 20th birthday celebration! 
I haven't organised much yet but I just wanted to lock the dates in early so that everyone can come.

I would really appreciate if everyone could come as I would like to make as much memories as possible before I head to the US üò¢ Hope to see you all there! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Dress code : neutral / beige colours

Drinks / food : I will be providing drinks (probably just some jugs of cocktails) and food

Restrictions : Since this penthouse is located in a residential area and the council is very strict with noise restrictions, I was told to keep the noise level low. Also with the current COVID-19 restrictions, I am allowed to have everyone over but if the government releases additional restrictions, things may change so I‚Äôll keep you updated!
