Alicia's left eye bled
I was about to go to bed with Alicia and saw her left eye bleeding. The blood smudged sm that her whole eye socket turned red. But she said she was fine
Later, we decided to go somewhere (I think it was woolies) and saw 광희. He asked us if we could interview and I got super excited but Alicia looked unhappy
so I kept asking her what's wrong and she just said she was tired but all of a sudden she fainted with her left eye bleeding and I started crying bc if she died it would've been my fault for not taking care of her.
I kept dialling 911 but it wouldn't work and realised I had to call 000 in Australia

never going to do an interview with 광희 if I do get to see him
