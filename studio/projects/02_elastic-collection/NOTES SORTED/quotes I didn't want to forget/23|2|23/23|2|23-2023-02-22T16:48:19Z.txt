A small part of it: 

Even winter nights can turn warm. Even eternity has a beginning. An overflow of emotions that I can’t control, can’t contain, can’t put into words. My heart beating until it turns gold.

Infinite people; a finite you, a finite me. Like two grains of sand meeting across oceans.
