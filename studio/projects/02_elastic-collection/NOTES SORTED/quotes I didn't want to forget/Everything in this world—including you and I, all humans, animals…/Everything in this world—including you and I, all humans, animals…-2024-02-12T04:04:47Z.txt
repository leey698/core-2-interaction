Everything in this world—including you and I, all humans, animals, ocean, and the internet—is constantly changing every second. We are not the same as who we were just one second ago. Nothing in this world stays the same.

“The world is constantly changing, so no matter how often we practice paying attention there will always be something new to notice. It’s up to us to find it.

Likewise, we are always changing, growing, evolving. We learn and forget things. We move through different moods, thoughts, and unconscious processes. The cells in our body die and regenerate. No one is the same person all day long.”
