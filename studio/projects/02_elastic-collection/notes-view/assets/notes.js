I would recommend saving some locations depending on the reviews<br>		In my opinion, most korean restaurants taste decent as long as the naver reviews aren't terrible. so I would say just explore the area, find some places that look good and look up to see their reviews, and if it's good then just go in and try!<br>		my list is mostly cafe because it's easy to find restaurants with decent food but  it's a bit hard to find aesthetic cafes that aren't mainstream imo. <br>		<br>		Top areas to visit<br>		Seong-su : lots of cafes and shops on the street (kind of expensive), lots of pop-up stores and exhibitions, i would say it's one of the most popular areas in seoul amongst ppl in their 20-30s!<br>		Seochon & Bukchon Hanok village: the hanok village is a top tourist area so you probably heard of it already but i personally like seochon way better cos it's a lot quieter with better cafes and shops. If you like visiting bookstores & quiet cafes, defs check out seochon (it's near gyeongbokgung palace so you should check out)<br>		Mangwon-dong: kind of retro, v local and a lot of small local cafes, you should also visit mangwon sijang if you got time<br>		Yeonhui-dong: it's an area above hongdae I haven't been to yet but there seems to be lots of nice cafes here<br>		Hannam-dong: it's like a fancy area near itaewon with a lot of restaurants and cafes! also a really big gallery called leeum is here so i would recommend visiting during the day<br>		Haebang-chon: it's a nice area to walk around near namsan tower, there are lots of hills and stairs and very residential but the streets are very artsy and the night view is amazing if you go to one of their rooftop bars/cafes!<br>		<br>		Cafe<br>		Inwangsan Daechung<br>		Ugly Bakery<br>		Cafe layered (franchise)<br>		Seongsu baking studio<br>		Foreplan<br>		Frolla<br>		Summer lane Hannam<br>		horangii coffee<br>		super matcha<br>		b-hind<br>		<br>		Restaurants<br>		seongsu myeongdang<br>		palette hannam<br>		hohosikdang (franchise)<br>		<br>		Bars<br>		Bar Cham<br>		Daechungpark<br>		Wynyard Seongsu (or any other bars on this street<br>		Noy seoul<br>		Damn good seoul<br>		Firerobbersclub<br>		<br>		Galleries / artsy shops<br>		Leeum (gallery closed on mon)<br>		LCDC seoul<br>		Alpi<br>		29cm seongsu<br>		poset<br>		onemorebag<br>		MMMG in hannam<br>		handle with care

Luckily the train was fairy empty so I was able to grab a seat. Gonna read my book now because I brought that heavy ass book with me!`

I lowkey worry about these people sometimes, am I being too naive to be caring for random druggos on the train?`

The screen that tells the train times said: Manhattan 0 min (flashing), and then 7 min. 7??? wtf, it's rush hour, 7 mins is unacceptable. Morning is not going so well but it only got worse when this random girl in scrubs would make the tiniest little space for me to fit on the seats. What does she gain from that. Like move over just a tad bit more and everyone would be at peace. I still squeezed myself in the tiny space that was given to me and decided to write some shit down so I feel better. I was kind contemplating getting back up because I'm so squished rn, but lowkey glad I sat cos the train is so damn packed rn. It stopped at Lorimer St Station and some people seem to be just waiting for the next train since this one is too full. Everyone on the train is quite bundled up this morning, but not as much as the people on Montreal. There's a girl weaeing a khaki trench coat, light blue jeans, pointy boots (??) and a chunky white scarf, and I really like her style. I also should look into getting a scarf soon`

I found an empty seat right where they were performing, so I got to watch the performance like a VIP and remembered--I have a 1 dollar bill in my wallet! I don't think I've ever tipped a subway busker, or let alone any buskers in NY, but I felt like today was the day. I rushed to whip my $1 bill out of my wallet to put it in the female busker's money collecting tote bag, and got a very sincere 'thank you' in return. everyone else on the train is also not so crazy or disrespectful. maybe wednesday mornings make everyone behave a bit better lol!`

		text: `not on my usual l train today, because I went to apple and uniqlo in soho. luckily I got on this M train before rush hour? so it's not jam packed body to body. or, maybe it's just that L train is always so fucking packed all the time so this train feels really empty. it's 5:35 pm and already pitch black outside. <br>		<br>		as I write these notes down I realised that I often like to observe other train commuters' facial expressions and outfits. it feels like everyone's facial expressions match their outfits. like if someone's super fitted up w maison margiela tabi boots and some sunglasses, I would never witness a smile on their face. always straight poker model face. oh nvm I just saw a girl wearing a leather jacket and tabi flats and she smiled... at her bf though. anyone can smile at the dumbest things when they're with someone they love are in love with! `

It is undoubtedly shit, I'm hoping it is dog shit but I'm afraid it's human shit. In nyc it is probably more likely that it's human shit...<br>		<br>		Luckily the shit is all dry and crusty so there is so smell. I'm sitting on the seats opposite to the seat with shit, I'm hoping my seat is clean. I can't believe I'm writing about shit on train seats. New york just being new york....`
