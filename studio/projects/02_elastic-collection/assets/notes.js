I would recommend saving some locations depending on the reviews<br>		In my opinion, most korean restaurants taste decent as long as the naver reviews aren't terrible. so I would say just explore the area, find some places that look good and look up to see their reviews, and if it's good then just go in and try!<br>		my list is mostly cafe because it's easy to find restaurants with decent food but  it's a bit hard to find aesthetic cafes that aren't mainstream imo. <br>		<br>		Top areas to visit<br>		Seong-su : lots of cafes and shops on the street (kind of expensive), lots of pop-up stores and exhibitions, i would say it's one of the most popular areas in seoul amongst ppl in their 20-30s!<br>		Seochon & Bukchon Hanok village: the hanok village is a top tourist area so you probably heard of it already but i personally like seochon way better cos it's a lot quieter with better cafes and shops. If you like visiting bookstores & quiet cafes, defs check out seochon (it's near gyeongbokgung palace so you should check out)<br>		Mangwon-dong: kind of retro, v local and a lot of small local cafes, you should also visit mangwon sijang if you got time<br>		Yeonhui-dong: it's an area above hongdae I haven't been to yet but there seems to be lots of nice cafes here<br>		Hannam-dong: it's like a fancy area near itaewon with a lot of restaurants and cafes! also a really big gallery called leeum is here so i would recommend visiting during the day<br>		Haebang-chon: it's a nice area to walk around near namsan tower, there are lots of hills and stairs and very residential but the streets are very artsy and the night view is amazing if you go to one of their rooftop bars/cafes!<br>		<br>		Cafe<br>		Inwangsan Daechung<br>		Ugly Bakery<br>		Cafe layered (franchise)<br>		Seongsu baking studio<br>		Foreplan<br>		Frolla<br>		Summer lane Hannam<br>		horangii coffee<br>		super matcha<br>		b-hind<br>		<br>		Restaurants<br>		seongsu myeongdang<br>		palette hannam<br>		hohosikdang (franchise)<br>		<br>		Bars<br>		Bar Cham<br>		Daechungpark<br>		Wynyard Seongsu (or any other bars on this street<br>		Noy seoul<br>		Damn good seoul<br>		Firerobbersclub<br>		<br>		Galleries / artsy shops<br>		Leeum (gallery closed on mon)<br>		LCDC seoul<br>		Alpi<br>		29cm seongsu<br>		poset<br>		onemorebag<br>		MMMG in hannam<br>		handle with care

I've never felt this drained, frustrated, and avoidant with any other class. to think that this is my last train ride to this class, I do of course feel a sense of regret—regretting that I was never on time, never gave it my 100 (not even 50 tbh), and didn't even really try to make things work. hopefully on the train ride back today, I’ll feel more relieved that it's done at least.`

The screen that tells the train times said: Manhattan 0 min (flashing), and then 7 min. 7??? wtf, it's rush hour, 7 mins is unacceptable. Morning is not going so well but it only got worse when this random girl in scrubs would make the tiniest little space for me to fit on the seats. What does she gain from that. Like move over just a tad bit more and everyone would be at peace. I still squeezed myself in the tiny space that was given to me and decided to write some shit down so I feel better. I was kind contemplating getting back up because I'm so squished rn, but lowkey glad I sat cos the train is so damn packed rn. It stopped at Lorimer St Station and some people seem to be just waiting for the next train since this one is too full. Everyone on the train is quite bundled up this morning, but not as much as the people on Montreal. There's a girl weaeing a khaki trench coat, light blue jeans, pointy boots (??) and a chunky white scarf, and I really like her style. I also should look into getting a scarf soon`

I found an empty seat right where they were performing, so I got to watch the performance like a VIP and remembered--I have a 1 dollar bill in my wallet! I don't think I've ever tipped a subway busker, or let alone any buskers in NY, but I felt like today was the day. I rushed to whip my $1 bill out of my wallet to put it in the female busker's money collecting tote bag, and got a very sincere 'thank you' in return. everyone else on the train is also not so crazy or disrespectful. maybe wednesday mornings make everyone behave a bit better lol!`

(필요가 없는 것 같음) 요즘은 엉덩이를 키우고싶은데 허벅지는 더 날씬해지고 톤업됐음 좋겠다. 헬스 꾸준히<br>\	다닌지 이제 6개월이 되가는데 느낀점은:<br>\	<br>\	운동은 제대로 (자세,효율성) 해야 효과가 있다. <br>\	운동 만으로는 살이 안빠진다<br>\	하체운동으로 허벅지가 더 두꺼워진것은 살짝 사실이다. 근데 엉덩이 자극을 제대로 알고 운동을 하면 허벅지가 두꺼워 질 일은 없을것이다<br>\	내가 원하는 글래머 섹시 여리 몸이 나오려면 중량운동을 꾸준히 하돼 유산소 + 식단은 필수다<br>\	<br>\	사실 난 운동을 제대로 시작하고 난 이후로 식습관도 꽤나 바뀌고 (제대로 제진 않지만 탄단지 비율을 신경썼음) 내가 좋아하던 밀크티랑 불닭볶음면도 한동안 아예 끊었었다. 요즘에 식욕이 폭발에 좀 자주 먹었지만 이제부터 다시 조금씩이라도 식단을 해야겠다. 안그러다간 그냥 몸만 벌크업 되고 말것이다.ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ<br>\	앞으로 내 자신과 약속을 몇 개 하고싶다<br>\	<br>\	운동은 적어도 일주일에 3번은 하자<br>\	단백질 챙긴 식사 하루 2번 꼭하기 (아침은 공복/간단한 식사)<br>\	운동후 단백질 꼭 챙겨먹기 <br>\	9시 이후에는 군것질 하지않기 (운동후 단백질 쉐이크나 바나나같은 탄수화물은 ok)<br>\	정말 먹고싶은게 있으면 먹자. 운동하면 된다<br>\	웨이트 끝나고 적어도 20분 유산소<br>\	<br>\	21/11/20 <br>\	<br>\	꾸준히 운동을 열심히 하고 있다. 사실 식단같은건 안하고 운동만 열심히 했는데, 곰곰히 생각해보면 나의 목표는 지방 감량 + 근육 토닝 인데 식단을 하나도 안하고 운동만 하니 몸이 더 커져보이는 느낌이다. 어제 하체운동을 하고 더 펌핑된 내 허벅지를 보고 또 힙은 안먹고 허벅지 운동만 됐나보다.. 하고 좌절했는데 생각해보니 내가 먹고싶은거 다 먹으면서 얇은 다리를 원하는건 앞뒤가 안 맞는 것 같다. 지금 다리 두께도 많이 두꺼운건 아니지만 특히나 청바지를 입었을 때 원하는 핏이 안나와서 요즘 많이 우울했다. 허벅지가 많이 타이트해서 바지 입을때 자신이없다.<br>\	이 시행착오를 몇번이나 반복해야 난 내가 원하는 몸을 가질 수 있을까..? 엉덩이는 많이 업 돼서 기쁘지만 허벅지도 같이 두꺼워지고 튼실해져서 기분이 안좋다. 이젠 정말 진지하게 식단을 해야겠다는 생각이 든다. 그렇다고 갑자기 다이어트 해야지! 이런 마음을 먹으면 오히려 음식들이 많이 땡긴다. 그렇기때문에 그냥 최대한 탄수화물을 줄여가며, 샐러드 같은 야채식을 고기와 겉들여 많이 먹으려고 한다. 그렇다고 아예 안먹지는 않을거다. 그냥 좀 많이 먹으면 다음날에 좀더 타이트하게 먹으면 되겠지뭐. 지금처럼 내가 좋아하는 웨이트 트레이닝은 꾸준히 하면서 식단조절을 하면, 정말 탄탄한 몸이 나올 것 같아서 기대된다. 내 자신이 불행하다고 생각이 들지 않는 선에서, 너무 타협하지 않으며 건강식을 해야겠다고 다짐을 했다. 화이팅!<br>\	<br>\	24/11/20<br>\	<br>\	매일 저녁은 건강식으로 먹기로 한 계획이 꽤나 잘 흘러가고 있다.(?) 첫째날에는 소고기와 샐러드를 먹었고, `

I never realised you actually need to use your forearm muscle while typing..<br>	they turn off the lights before 9pm and the elevator gets locked up <br>	<br>	6/2/2023<br>	<br>	1:52pm<br>	today is surgery day. yesterday, my arm sling ripped from the heavy weight of the arm cast + ice pack last night, so I asked the nurse to bring me a new one which I haven't received yet.<br>	this morning, I didn't get a needle on my butt. i thought the pain has become more tolerable because i got better, but it was actually the painkiller that made the pain more tolerable<br>	<br>	4:45pm<br>	15mins till i go into the surgery room. Ahhhhhhhh I'm kinda nervous now, i hope it doesn't hurt too much<br>	I'm also very hungry and I've been craving about stracciatella like crazy..<br>	<br>	5:15pm<br>	when i first got there, the anaesthesiologist was waiting. it wasn't as cold as i thought it would be. they tied my right arm up and unwrapped the bandage on my left arm. the doctor put my arm up in a position and started pinching my armpit to shoot the anaesthesia. i suddenly felt an electric tingle in my fingers and started feeling numb. that shit hurt like crazy<br>	<br>	5:48pm<br>	surgery started and i was wide awake. i still had some senses left in my fingers and arm but they eventually got completely numb to the point where i couldn't even move a millimeter. i could actually feel my skin get cut — as scary as it sounds, it actually felt pretty cool. i could feel what was going on without feeling any pain. <br>	<br>	i heard lots of cutting sound. i assumed they were cutting the layers of skin and muscles.<br>	as i heard a beeping noise, i heard some sucking noise. it was probably the suction sucking my blood in.<br>	
	i fell asleep briefly for like 20 minutes during surgery bc i got a little tired of looking at the same screen. i got woken up by some noises of the doctors speaking, then soon after i heard (and felt) some intense drilling. it was so strong that the drilling created some sort of wind that blew my hair. it felt weird that i didn't feel any pain bc i was pretty sure that they were drilling holes in my bone. also, they used a lot of force and pressure during the surgery. i even felt my bed moving and shaking a little every time the doctor was trying to do something. they also put all the tools on top of the cloth covering my body. the tools felt quite heavy on my feet, but i couldn't do much about it since i was tied up. <br>
	<br>	the surgery went on for longer than expected. i was told that it was a difficult surgery, as there were many shattered pieces of bones in the broken area. they concluded the surgery by stapling my skin. it actually sounded like a legit stapler. hope my scar isn't too big<br>	<br>	7/2/2023<br>	<br>	5:46 am<br>	i woke up about an hour ago in the middle of my sleep. i was sweating quite a lot but i still couldn't feel any sort of sense or pain in my arm and fingers.<br>	i tried hard to move my fingers; i used my right hand to bend them, and constantly pinched them to see if i could feel anything. <br>	<br>	as I'm writing this now, I'm starting to feel the anaesthesia wearing off. i can finally move my fingers a little and I'm also starting to feel the slight pain in my forearm. i wonder how bad the pain will be when the anaesthesia completely wears off..<br>	<br>	8/2/2023<br>	<br>	10:47pm<br>	I hadn’t written anything yesterday because the day just went so quickly without having done much. I thought time would pass by a lot more slowly being in the hospital, but it actually passes by a lot quicker. <br>	<br>	Yesterday, I still didn't fully gain back the senses in my fin`

	Living preferences<br>	Jen - I prefer to keep the shared space nice and tidy. I make sure to not leave any dishes unwashed overnight and I also wipe after every time I use the kitchen. <br>	<br>	Cleaning<br>	Jen - I would prefer to share cleaning supplies with everyone under the assumption that everyone contributes to the supply costs<br>	<br>	Cooking<br>	Jen - I usually cook most days, although when things get busy with school I’ll probably skip meals or eat out. I would really appreciate if everyone could do their dishes as soon as they finish eating, and also wipe the bench surfaces after every use. I don’t think we would need a schedule if everyone did their part in cleaning after themselves<br>	<br>	Sleeping habits<br>	Jen - 1-2 am weekdays, 1-3 weekends, wake up at 8-10 weekdays, 10-12 weekends, can’t sleep with light or music<br>	<br>	Communication<br>	Jen - I usually bring issues up and confront if needed, but I would also like to be as respectful as possible. As long as everyone respects each other’s differences I don’t think I will have any issues.<br>	<br>	Health and hygiene<br>	Jen - Mostly shower at night before bed from 12-1am, and I shower around 5 days a week. I don’t have any allergies.<br>	<br>	Classes<br>	Jen - 9 am classes 4 days a week, and all my classes finish before 3pm. I usually stay up late at night if I have work I have to finish by the next day.<br>	<br>	Homework<br>	Jen - I usually do homework after dinner time (after 7). On weekends, unless I go out, I usually stay home and try to do my work as soon as I wake up. I prefer to work in silence but I don’t mind having chill/calm music in the background (no lyrics, just instrumental). I prefer to work by myself and I usually find loud noises distracting (if it’s noisy even with my headphones on)<br>	<br>	<br>	Living preferences<br>	Room B - We like to keep our room neat and try to make the bed everyday. We also like to not have stuff lying around on the floor.<br>	<br>	Cleaning<br>	Room B - We share the vacuum to clean our room together. We both make sure to keep our own area clean, so that it’s fair for both of us. We will try to vacuum our room at least once a week, and we will try to clean the room everyday.<br>	<br>	Personal property<br>	Room B - We don’t share much stuff but we let each other borrow things when needed. We would like to be asked when our things need to be borrowed.<br>	<br>	Guests in common area <br>
	Jen - I don’t mind having friends over, and I sometimes invite my friends over for dinner. I would prefer them gone by 11-12 and hang in the lounge if possible. I would prefer if guests are over when I’m not in the room.`

	If you're focused on something and grind for an extended period, I feel like your body adapts to it quite quickly and goes in full work mode. I feel this way whenever a deadline is close - I'm usually able to eventually get the design and idea I want in the matter of days or even hours. But when I'm done with something, I'm just so sick of  the idea of working and I feel like I literally shut myself down from any work. Rest is important and much needed of course, but I feel like I learned so much from being so focused on my work and my projects the past few weeks. It was probably my most transformative and fast growing time period in my design journey yet, so wouldn't it be a waste to just throw this all away?<br>	<br>	let's keep working and learning, and keep improving. all i have right now is time, and with this much passion and knowledge i have in my design, i know i can keep creating so many more cool things. `
