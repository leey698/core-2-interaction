		I've been so unbelievably unmotivated for this class. I've never felt this drained, frustrated, and avoidant with any other class. to think that this is my last train ride to this class, I do of course feel a sense of regret—regretting that I was never on time, never gave it my 100 (not even 50 tbh), and didn't even really try to make things work. hopefully on the train ride back today, I’ll feel more relieved that it's done at least.`

The screen that tells the train times said: Manhattan 0 min (flashing), and then 7 min. 7??? wtf, it's rush hour, 7 mins is unacceptable. Morning is not going so well but it only got worse when this random girl in scrubs would make the tiniest little space for me to fit on the seats. What does she gain from that. Like move over just a tad bit more and everyone would be at peace. I still squeezed myself in the tiny space that was given to me and decided to write some shit down so I feel better. I was kind contemplating getting back up because I'm so squished rn, but lowkey glad I sat cos the train is so damn packed rn. It stopped at Lorimer St Station and some people seem to be just waiting for the next train since this one is too full. Everyone on the train is quite bundled up this morning, but not as much as the people on Montreal. There's a girl weaeing a khaki trench coat, light blue jeans, pointy boots (??) and a chunky white scarf, and I really like her style. I also should look into getting a scarf soon`

I found an empty seat right where they were performing, so I got to watch the performance like a VIP and remembered--I have a 1 dollar bill in my wallet! I don't think I've ever tipped a subway busker, or let alone any buskers in NY, but I felt like today was the day. I rushed to whip my $1 bill out of my wallet to put it in the female busker's money collecting tote bag, and got a very sincere 'thank you' in return. everyone else on the train is also not so crazy or disrespectful. maybe wednesday mornings make everyone behave a bit better lol!`

		as I write these notes down I realised that I often like to observe other train commuters' facial expressions and outfits. it feels like everyone's facial expressions match their outfits. like if someone's super fitted up w maison margiela tabi boots and some sunglasses, I would never witness a smile on their face. always straight poker model face. oh nvm I just saw a girl wearing a leather jacket and tabi flats and she smiled... at her bf though. anyone can smile at the dumbest things when they're with someone they love are in love with! `
