            <p>Sonder is a Collection of iCloud Notes by Jennifer Lee. 
                <br><br>
            By dictionary, the word sonder [son-der] is defined as: 
                <br><br>
            <i>'the feeling one has on realizing that every other individual one sees has a life as full and real as one's own, in which they are the central character and others, including oneself, have secondary or insignificant roles'</i>.
                <br><br>
            This project invites you to have a moment of sonder. When we take notes—either with a pen or on our phones—we are actively leaving detailed traces of our lives in the moment. These notes may seem trivial when seen or read individually, but when gathered into a collection, they become a significant part of one's identity.
