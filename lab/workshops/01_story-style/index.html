        1. In a corner of the rectangular living room in my rectangular apartment was a rectangular box connected with a tangled set of thick, black, cables behind it. The box was called the ‘computer’.

        2. All I had to do to use it was to press the circular button on top of the box and wait for a couple of minutes. Once it was turned on, a bright screen with a log-in box would appear.

        3. Logging in was simple. I typed in a set of letters into the box, and after waiting a few seconds again, the desktop would appear. Finally, the time has come.

        4. However, there was one more rectangular box waiting for me to press. The timer. My parents had placed a small desk timer next to the computer, and told us that we had to press ‘start’ as soon as we began surfing on the internet.

        5. Click. The first click on the computer would begin as soon as the timer began to count down. 30 minutes was all I had, but it was everything I had.
